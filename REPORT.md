# Report Introduction: 

We built a web app that stores data in a PostgreSQL database to practise working with remote databases. 

# User Stories:

- I have strong opinions on ice cream and want to share them
- I want to read others' views on ice cream
- I like structure and want a tailored form in which to submit my opinions
- I use a screen reader and want to post and read posts

## Core features:

- user can post
- user can see posts
- posts are stored remotely
  
# Team members:

  - [Maria](https://github.com/mariaalouisaa): Scrum Facilitator
  - [Alex](https://github.com/lascellesabercrombie): DevOps
  - [Sonia](https://github.com/sonianb): Quality Assurance
  - [Peter](https://github.com/PJSalter): UX Lead

# Project learnings:

We began the day with morning stand-ups and continued with regular check-ins throughout the day when pair-programming. When working as a group, we were mindful of taking breaks. We were disciplined about asking for help from each other and from mentors when we stalled for too long.

With compressed timescale, we could possibly have spent less time distinguishing and labelling issues at the beginning (but this might have caused issues later!). Integrating error handling into code early on would have been helpful. 

# Requirement analysis:

- Maria did various accessibility tests, including lighthouse tests and navigating through the site with a built-in screenreader. 
- Semantic HTML in the form. 
- No legal or copyright issues.

# ðŸ§  Project scope:

A more complex app might have allowed replies, a delete or edit function, and a choice of filters.

# Recommendations and conclusions:

The project was a success! All acceptance criteria were achieved, though we did not have time for the stretch goals in the end. We are proud of our persistence and grateful for the help we received!
